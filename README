                      SMALL-FOOTPRINT CIM BROKER (sfcb)
                      ---------------------------------

What is sfcb
==============================
sfcb is a lightweight CIM daemon (aka CIMOM) that responds to CIM client
requests for system management data and/or performs system management 
tasks. sfcb supports most of the standard CIM XML over http/https protocol.
It is highly modular, allowing functionality to be easily added, removed
or customized for different management applications. sfcb is specifically
targeted for small embedded system that do not have the available CPU,
memory or disk resources to support a full-blown enterprise-level CIMOM.
That said, sfcb runs very well on a regular Linux/Unix system and supports
most of the functions required by CIM clients to manage such the system. 

Documentation
==============================

The sfcb documentation is maintained in the sfcb wiki on Sourceforge.
